        <h2>Mystery moon crash due to China’s space 'blunder', claim scientists</h2>
        <p>NEW DELHI: A recent study has officially solved the mysterious incident on March 4, 2022, involving a crash on the moon. Scientists from the University of Arizona determined that a stray rocket from China, specifically a Long March 3C, reportedly collided with the moon's far side.
            The impact created a double crater approximately 95 feet (29 meters) wide near the Hertzsprung Crater, resolving the mystery of what occurred more than a year back.</p>

                <h3>Malaysia Announces Visa-Free Entry To Citizens From India, China From Dec 1</h3>
                <img src="https://imgnew.outlookindia.com/uploadimage/library/16_9/16_9_2/IMAGE_1677731172.webp" alt="Article 1 Image">
                <p>Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has announced that this country will grant visa-free entry to citizens of India and China for stays of up to 30 days.

                    The visa-free entry to the people of India and China will start on December 1, Ibrahim said, as per Reuters report.
                    
                    Anwar made the announcement late on Sunday during a speech at his People's Justice Party congress and did not say for how long the visa exemption would be applicable, the report said.
                    
                    China and India are Malaysia's fourth and fifth-largest source markets respectively.
                    
                    According to government data, Malaysia recorded 9.16 million tourist arrivals between January and June this year, with 498,540 from China and 283,885 from India, it said.
                    
                    “That compared to 1.5 million arrivals from China and 354,486 from India in the same period of 2019, prior to the pandemic,” it mentioned.
                    
                    The move follows similar measures implemented by neighbouring Thailand to boost its vital tourism sector and stimulate its sluggish economy, with Chinese and Indian nationals among those exempted this year, it said.
                    
                    Currently, Chinese and Indian nationals must apply for visas to enter Malaysia, it added.</p>

                <h3>Myanmar Civil War: China Calls For An Immediate Ceasefire</h3>
                <img src="https://imgnew.outlookindia.com/uploadimage/library/16_9/16_9_2/IMAGE_1666851412.webp" alt="Article 2 Image">
             
                <p>Beijing has called for an immediate ceasefire in Myanmar's escalating civil conflict. This comes after a group of armed people, including the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), Arakan Army (AA), and Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), took control of an important trading spot between the two countries over the weekend.

                    Myanmar, a South-East Asian nation of 54 million people, is currently embroiled in a civil war with numerous armed ethnic and pro-democracy factions fighting the military junta which threw an elected government out of power in a sudden coup in 2021. 
                    
                    The armed alliance's offensive against the Aung Min Hlaing-led junta has resulted in the rebels gaining control of numerous military positions and a strategically significant town for trade with China. The junta government has acknowledged losing at least three towns, posing the toughest armed challenge to the junta since its ascent to power three years ago.
                    
                    In response, China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) expressed determination to safeguard border security in an editorial published on Sunday by PLA Daily, the news website of the Chinese military.
                    
                    “Maintaining the security and stability of the China-Myanmar border is the common aspiration and well-being of the two peoples,” it said.
                    
                    “China pays close attention to the relevant conflicts in northern Myanmar and urges relevant parties to immediately cease fire and engage in peaceful dialogue to avoid escalation of the situation.”</p>

                <h3>Russia Launches Largest Drone Attack So Far In Ukraine's Kyiv, Wounds 5 Civilians Including A Child</h3>
                <img src="https://imgnew.outlookindia.com/uploadimage/library/16_9/16_9_2/IMAGE_1700982961.webp" alt="Article 3 Image">
                
                <p>Russia launched a vigorous drone attack on Ukraine on Saturday morning, the largest one since the onset of the full-scale invasion in 2022, specifically targeting the Ukrainian capital, as confirmed by military officials.

                    In the entirety of the attack, Russia deployed 75 Shahed drones of Iranian origin against Ukraine, with Ukraine's air force reporting the successful destruction of 74 of them through air defences.
                    
                    “Kyiv was the main target,” Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk wrote on his Telegram channel.
                    
                    The attack was “the most massive air attack by drones on Kyiv,” said Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv city administration. Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Ihnat confirmed later that the air defences shot down 66 air targets over the capital and surrounding region throughout the morning.
                    
                    At least five civilians were wounded in the hourslong assault, which saw several buildings damaged by falling debris from downed drones, including a kindergarten. The wounded included an 11-year-old child, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko.</p>
