    <p>From Dandi March To Bharat Jodo Yatra: Tracing Role Of Sacrifice In Indian Politics<br>
      In December 2016, a few weeks after demonetisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing a rally, said: “Jyada se jyada kya kar lenge? Arey hum toh fakeer aadmi hai, jhola leke nikal lenge (What can my opponents do to me? I am a hermit. I will exit with my few belongings)”. While this part of his speech became famous in the following days through social media, it was not the first time that the projected image of a political leader as a fakir or saint got political traction.
      Since the days of Mahatma Gandhi, a true leader in India has been considered to be an embodiment of three quintessential features—asceticism, sacrifice and celibacy. Among these, the most powerful tool has been the evocation of sacrifice. As Modi was shown meditating in a cave in Uttarakhand just a few days prior to the declaration of the 2019 General Election results, his persona was viewed from the lens of abstinence—a stage where a person sacrifices the comfort of material life to achieve some high moral ground.
      While the portrayal of Modi as a saintly figure is a part of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) decade-long strategy, in the last few years, projecting his spiritual side, spreading the message of love, abandoning material comfort and showcasing a deep engagement in the ideal of ‘sewa’, Rahul Gandhi has emerged as the embodiment of the necessary saintly impulses that seem to counterweight his rival’s projected image.
      However, one can’t miss the differences in the evocation of two forms of sacrifices. On the one hand, there are Modi’s references to his personal sacrifices—like leaving his wife for indulging in the service of the nation, echoing Gautam Buddha’s idea of ‘sanyas’; on the other, the martyrdoms of Gandhi family members have never left the mindscape of Rahul Gandhi. Sugata Srinivasaraju, the author of Strange Burden, rightly says that whenever Rahul Gandhi recounts the loss of his family members, he takes a 20-second pause, and then talks about ‘forgiveness’.
      Since he joined politics, Gandhi has invoked the sacrifices of his father and grandmother several times. In March this year, when he was disqualified from Parliament, besides updating his status as ‘disqualified MP’, he wrote, “Satya, sahaas aur balidaan—ye humari virasat hai, aur yahi hamari takaat bhi”.
      To emphasise the balidaan (sacrifice), the post was accompanied with a video that showed Priyanka Gandhi addressing a rally and recalling her father’s death. In the backdrop, one can see the archival shots of Rahul Gandhi carrying the body of his father during his last journey. Priyanka Gandhi says: “Rahul got out of the car and carried the dead body of my father in the scorching heat from Trimurti. And now, the son of a shahid PM is called anti-national. Referring to the sacrifices of her family, she adds, “The democracy of the country has been built upon the sacrifices my family members have made.”</p>

        <p>Lok Sabha 2024: Has INDIA Ignored The Country's Past Coalition Lessons?<br>
          Ahead of the 1977 Lok Sabha election, the repression of Emergency rule had helped a wide range of the Congress’ opponents, from opposite ideological poles, give up their separate identities and form a unified platform to dethrone Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
           They gathered around freedom fighter Jayprakash ‘JP’ Narayan, the tallest living politician of the time, who served as the nucleus of the newly-launched Janata Party. He was the face of a united opposition to Gandhi’s authoritarianis
          Prior to the 1989 Lok Sabha election, again a range of opposition parties came together against Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, especially on corruption charges. An opposition alliance formed around dissident Congress leader Vishwanath Pratap Singh,
           who had launched his own party, Janata Dal, initiating what is often considered the ‘second Janata experiment.’In 1996, a post-poll coalition of various regional parties wanted the CPI(M)’s Jyoti Basu—the Bengal chief minister for 19 years straight at that time—to take up the premiership and serve as the nucleus.
           His party did not allow it, though. The Left parties were not formally part of any of these coalitions but extended external support when necessary. 
          Ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election, an apparently apolitical anti-corruption movement developed against the Congress’ Manmohan Singh government with social worker Anna Hazare as the main face. Though centred in Delhi, the movement helped spread anti-Congress sentiments to different parts of the country until the BJP announced Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi—already a polarising name—as their prime ministerial face. Modi’s anti-corruption pitch took off from where Hazare had left it.
          Now, the question of the face or anchoring force of the opposition has started ringing louder as the 2024 Lok Sabha election inches forth, with opposition parties of varying ideologies and interests trying to stitch together a common platform of as many anti-BJP forces as possible.
          The INDIA bloc—the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance­—though, is still far away from beginning any seat-sharing talks or presenting any roadmap. For the first time, in any such initiative at the national level, the Left parties are formally a part of it. But the platform itself has yet to take any shape or find a nucleus for others to gather around.
          One of the major challenges before the current opposition unity initiative is that the parties that came together in 1977 and 1989 had less competitive interest between themselves than the opposition forces in today’s INDIA.
          Now, the question of the face or anchoring force of the opposition has started ringing louder as the 2024 Lok Sabha election inches forth, with opposition parties of varying ideologies and interests trying to stitch together a common platform of as many anti-BJP forces as possible.</p>

        <p>From Agricultural Distress To Missing Schemes, Adivasis Seek Parties To Address Their Many Issues In Madhya Pradesh Elections<br>
          A bucket of water kept inside the barely-lit, tiny kaccha house of Namsingh Singhar is the only ‘emergency supply’ for the four-member household. “The only source of water for us is the nearby hand pump. In summers, even that goes dry,” says Singhar, who belongs to the Bhil Adivasi community of Jhabua district in Madhya Pradesh that is all set to go to the polls on November 17.
          Showing a tap that was installed a couple of months ago but has been inoperative since, the father of three sons and two daughters says, “It does not matter who comes to power. Nothing is going to change. We will have to struggle for roti, kapda and makaan.”
          Singhar, who is in his mid-50s, has not received funds from the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) to make a pucca ghar. The Jal Jeevan Mission scheme—the central government initiative to supply tap water to every household—is yet to reach his house.
          While two of his sons had to migrate to Gujarat as construction workers for better majdoori, one of them helps him in farming. With the decline in intergenerational wealth due to the increasing number of family members, they are now left with only one acre of land where they cultivate mostly corn and cotton. “Due to the lack of irrigation facilities, we can barely produce wheat. The corn produce is not sufficient for survival,” says Singhar, a resident of Chhoti Kheiru village that falls in the Petlawad Assembly constituency. However, two of his daughters-in-law are now getting Rs 1,250 per month through Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s Ladli Bahna Yojana—a scheme that a few consider could prove to be a game-changer for the BJP, which is reeling under the anti-incumbency factor.
          Singhar is just one among lakhs of Adivasis from Bhil, Gond, Kol, Kurku, Sahariya, Baiga and several other tribes who are considered as the kingmakers of the state due to their formidable population of 21.1 per cent, as per the 2011 census. From Malwa-Nimar and Mahakoshal to the Vindhya region, the condition of the Adivasis has hardly improved in the past two decades. “Everyone was busy making profiles. The Adivasis were mostly being used as a vote bank throughout,” says Virendra Singh Rathore, a senior journalist who has been covering Western Madhya Pradesh for years.  
          The strongest evidence of such negligence is found in the recently-released reports of the multi-dimensional poverty index. As per the reports, Jhabua—commonly known as the Adivasi capital of the state—is the poorest of all in MP with 49.6 per cent people found to be multi-dimensionally poor. Among the top-ten poorest districts in the state, six have more than 70 per cent Adivasi population.
          In Madhya Pradesh, among the 230 Assembly seats, 47 are reserved for the STs. However, there are at least another 35 seats where Adivasis have more than 60,000 votes, points out Anand Rai, senior leader of Jay Adivasi Yuva Shakti (JAYS)—one of the major Adivasi pressure groups in western MP’s tribal-dominated Malwa-Nimar region.</p>
